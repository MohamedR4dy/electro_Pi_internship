## Word Classifier: Sports vs Food

 **Description:** 🏀🍔This project introduces a word classifier that discerns whether a given sentence is related to sports or food. The concept involves analyzing words in the input sentence, tallying sports-associated and food-associated words, and then determining if the sentence leans towards sports, food, or neutrality.

**How it Works:**

1. Define word dictionaries for sports and food.
2. Input sentences for analysis.
3. Split sentences into words and match them with the dictionaries.
4. Count sports and food-related words.
5. Decide if the sentence is about sports, food, or neutral.

Experience basic text classification through predefined word lists. Discover how your sentences are categorized! 🎾🍕
